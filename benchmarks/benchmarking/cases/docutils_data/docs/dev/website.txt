 Docutils Web Site

The Docutils web site, <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/>, is
maintained by the ``docutils-update.local`` script, run by project
maintainers on their local machines.  The script
will process any .txt file which is newer than the corresponding .html
file in the local copy of the project's web directory and upload the changes
to the web site at SourceForge.

..  .. old instructions, for cron job:

    The Docutils web site, <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/>, is
    maintained automatically by the ``docutils-update`` script, run as an
    hourly cron job on shell.berlios.de (by user "wiemann").  The script
    will process any .txt file which is newer than the corresponding .html
    file in the project's web directory on shell.berlios.de
    (``/home/groups/docutils/htdocs/aux/htdocs/``) and upload the changes
    to the web site at SourceForge.

Please **do not** add any generated .html files to the Docutils
repository.  They will be generated automatically after a one-time
setup (`described below`__).

__ `Adding .txt Files`_

The docutils-update.local__ script is located at
``sandbox/infrastructure/docutils-update.local``.

__ https://docutils.sourceforge.io/sandbox/infrastructure/docutils-update.local

If you want to share files via the web, you can upload them using the
uploaddocutils.sh__ script
(``sandbox/infrastructure/uploaddocutils.sh``).

Setting Up
==========

(TBA)

.. hint::
  Anyone with checkin privileges can be a web-site maintainer. You need to
  set up the directories for a local website build.

  The procedure for that was on the docutils-devel list a while ago.


Adding .txt Files
=================

User/Contributor
----------------

When adding a new .txt file that should be converted to HTML:

#. Edit sandbox/infrastructure/htmlfiles.lst, and add the .html file
   corresponding to the new .txt file (please keep the sorted order).

#. Commit the edited version to the SVN repository.

Maintainer
----------

#. If there are new directories in the SVN, allow the update script to run
   once to create the directories in the filesystem before preparing for
   HTML processing.

#. Run the sandbox/infrastructure/update-htmlfiles shell script to generate
   .html files::

      cd <DOCUTILS-ROOT>/docutils/
      sandbox/infrastructure/update-htmlfiles \
      sandbox/infrastructure/htmlfiles.lst

   (Maybe this should become part of docutils-update.local.)


Removing Files & Directories
============================

#. Remove from SVN

#. Remove to-be-generated HTML files from
   ``sandbox/infrastructure/htmlfiles.lst``.

#. Removing files and directories from SVN will not trigger their removal
   from the web site.  Files and directories must be manually removed from
   sourceforge.net (under ``/home/project-web/docutils/htdocs/``).
