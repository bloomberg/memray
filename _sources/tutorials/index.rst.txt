About This Tutorial
===================

The tutorials in this section of the docs provide a gentle introduction to debugging memory issues using the Memray
profiler. You'll learn how to use basic features like generating flame graphs and integrating Memray with pytest test
suites, as well as some more advanced features like inspecting the C, C++, or Rust frames on the call stack in addition
to the Python frames.

There are 3 different exercises within this tutorial:
    - :doc:`Exercise 1 <1>` - Fibonacci Sequence
    - :doc:`Exercise 2 <2>` - Clinging Onto memory
    - :doc:`Exercise 3 <3>` - LRU Cache

You should follow them in the order they're presented here, as each builds on concepts introduced by the last.
