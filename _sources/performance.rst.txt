Performance
===========

This section contains an analysis of the overhead of running Memray over different
test cases and configurations. All these test cases come from the official Python performance
suite: `pyperformance <http://github.com/python/pyperformance>`_.

Every test is executed many times using the `perf <http://github.com/python/pyperf>`_ tool
in a machine specifically tuned to obtain reproducible performance results. The machine uses
isolated CPUs with fixed frequencies to run the benchmarks. You can read more about how the
machine is tuned for benchmarks in the `perf documentation about tuning a system
<https://pyperf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system.html>`_.

These purpose of these results are to give you an idea of the overhead of running Memray
with different options. Of course, these results will vary from machine to machine but they
can give you an approximation of what to expect.

Source of the overhead
----------------------

The overhead of running Memray comes from two places:

- A `Python profile function <https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setprofile>`_ implemented in
  C++. This function is called every time a Python function is called or returns
  and is used to register the function calls so Memray can reconstruct the
  stack trace of every allocation. Although the overhead is very, very small, it
  adds up. This means that the more your application calls Python
  functions the bigger the overhead will be.
- The allocation registering code. This is the main source of the overhead.
  Every time your application makes a memory allocation or deallocation,
  Memray needs to register it. This means that the more frequently your application
  allocates memory, the bigger the overhead will be. Tracking Python allocators
  will greatly increase this overhead because the Python allocator is used for
  small, short lived objects which means that it's generally called with very high
  frequency.

Results
-------

The following plots show the overhead of running Memray over different test
cases using violin plots. Each row corresponds to the result of a given test.
For a given row, the continuos vertical line in the middle corresponds to the
**mean** while the two dashed vertical vars at the left and right of the mean
correspond to the **10% and 90% quantiles**.  The shaded area represents the
distribution of the data, with thicker areas indicating a higher density of data
points. The **ALL** row corresponds to the distribution of all the results across all the
benchmarks combined.

Default options
