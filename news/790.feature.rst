Added ``--no-web`` flag to ``flamegraph`` and ``table`` commands for offline HTML report generation. When this flag is specified, memray bundles all external dependencies (Bootstrap, jQuery, D3, DataTables, Plotly.js) directly into the generated HTML files instead of loading them from CDNs. This enables memray to generate fully functional HTML reports on airgapped systems without internet connectivity.
