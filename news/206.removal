Up until now, if the program being profiled included a Cython module built with profiling support enabled, those Cython functions would show up in our Python call stacks. This was rarely useful in practice, as most Cython libraries aren't distributed with profiling support enabled, and supporting this had a surprisingly high maintenance cost. We've removed this integration, so you'll need to use ``--native`` mode to see inside of Cython modules. We are not considering this a backwards-incompatible change, since it does not affect any of our public interfaces (though it could affect the contents of reports generated by Memray).
