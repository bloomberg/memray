Live Reporting
==============

Overview
--------

Memray supports presenting a "live" view for observing the heap memory usage of a running Python program.
This provides insight into how memory is allocated as the program executes.

It is especially helpful for investigating the behavior of a program that has different allocation patterns during
different stages of the program's execution. It lets you see what the peak heap usage has been and how much memory is
being allocated by various parts of the program. The information is presented in a tabular format, showing how much of
the in-use memory each function directly allocated ("own memory"), how much was cumulatively allocated by that function
and everything it called ("total memory"), and the cumulative count of not yet freed allocations performed by that
function and everything it called ("allocation count").

Usage
-----

To use live mode, you can specify the program to be profiled in live mode using ``run --live``:

.. code:: shell-session

  $ memray run --live application.py

Immediately Memray will start your process in the background and will connect a TUI to it in the foreground. The TUI will
display the current high watermark of the heap every time it takes a snapshot, in a tabular format.

This view presents the following information:

- What the PID is of the running process.
- What command was used to invoke the program.
- The current heap size and the peak heap size seen so far.
- How long the program has been running.
- How many snapshots of the memory (referred to as samples) have been presented.
- A plot of the heap size over time.

Once the program has exited, there will be a message presented in the live view, stating that "Remote has disconnected".

Sorting results
---------------

The results are displayed in descending order of total memory allocated by a function and the subfunctions called by
it. You can change the ordering with the following keyboard shortcuts:

- t (default): Sort by total memory
- o: Sort by own memory
- a: Sort by allocation count

In most terminals you can also click the "Sort by Total", "Sort by Own", and "Sort by Allocations" buttons on the
footer.

The sorted column's heading is underlined.

Viewing different threads
-------------------------

By default, the ``live`` command will present the main thread of the program. You can look at different threads of the
program by pressing the greater than and less than keys, ``<`` and ``>``. In most terminals you can also click the
"Previous Thread" and "Next Thread" buttons on the footer.

Using with native tracking
--------------------------

It is possible to use :ref:`native tracking` along with the live mode. This can be achieved by passing ``--native``
to the ``run`` command.

.. code:: shell-session

  $ memray run --live --native application.py

Remote mode
-----------

Remote mode allows you to run the program to be traced in one process and the tui in another. To use remote mode, you can
specify the program to be profiled in live mode using ``run --live-remote``:

.. code:: shell-session

  $ memray run --live-remote application.py
  Run 'memray live <port>' in another shell to see live results

As you can see, Memray is now waiting on a connection to the live tracking server. You can now attach to
the server using running the ``live`` command in a separate shell.

.. code:: shell-session

  $ # Run this in a different shell:
  $ memray live <port>

This command will connect to the server that was started in the previous command, when given the requested port number.
Once the connection is established, the program will start executing. All memory allocations and deallocations
throughout the program will be tracked.

The program being tracked will present its output on the shell running the ``run --live-remote`` command. In the shell running
the ``live`` command, information about the program will be presented with the regular TUI of live mode.


Using a different port
----------------------

It is possible to make ``run --live-remote`` start the server on a user-specified port, using the ``--live-port`` argument.

.. code:: shell-session

  $ memray run --live-remote --live-port 12345 application.py
  Run 'memray live 12345' in another shell to see live results

.. important::

  Due to the syntax of the command line arguments of memray, make sure that you pass any options intended for the
  ``run`` command *before* your script/module. Otherwise, they will be treated as arguments for the script and will not
  be used by Memray.

  For example, the following invocation will pass ``--live-port 12345`` to ``application.py``,
  instead of having it be used by ``memray run``:

  .. code:: shell-session

    $ memray run --live-remote application.py --live-port 12345
    Run 'memray live 60125' in another shell to see live results
