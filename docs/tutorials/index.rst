About This Tutorial
===================

The tutorials in this section of the docs provide a gentle introduction to debugging memory issues using the Memray profiler.
You'll learn how to use basic features like generating flame graphs and Pytest API integration, as well as some more advanced
features like native mode for inspecting underlying C++ libraries.

There are 3 different excerises within this tutorial:
    - Excerise 1 - Fibonacci Sequence
    - Excerise 2 - Clinging Onto memory
    - Excerise 3 - LRU Cache

You should follow them in the order they're presented here, as each builds on concepts introduced by the last.
